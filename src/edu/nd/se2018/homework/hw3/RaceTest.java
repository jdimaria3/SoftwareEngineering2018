/* 
 * Here are some ideas for testing your race. You should create your own test cases 
 * though -- this assumes that you have a race class and a method called 
 * enrollHorse which accepts a horse name (String), a horse number (int), 
 * initial speed (int), and a strategy.  You don't need to have these classes -- 
 * you could have a different design and modify the tests accordingly.

// Test ideas #1
//race.enrollHorse("Sam",0,22,new EarlySprintStrategy());
//race.enrollHorse("Molly",1,24,new SlowStartStrategy());
//race.enrollHorse("Joe",2,25,new EarlySprintStrategy());
//race.enrollHorse("Blizzard",3,25,new SlowStartStrategy());
//race.enrollHorse("Flicker",4,25,new SteadyRunStrategy());	
//Winner is Blizzard
	
// Test ideas #2
//race.enrollHorse("Sam",0,22,new EarlySprintStrategy());
//race.enrollHorse("Molly",1,22,new EarlySprintStrategy());
//Winner is Sam (most likely -- depending on your move method)

// Test idea #3
//race.enrollHorse("Sam",0,100,new EarlySprintStrategy());
//race.enrollHorse("Molly",1,100,new SlowStartStrategy());
//Winner is Molly
